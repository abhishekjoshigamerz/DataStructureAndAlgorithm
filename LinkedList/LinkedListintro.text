A linked list is a linear data structure resembling a chain, where each node is connected to the next, and each node represents an individual element. Unlike arrays, the elements in a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

A linked list is a data structure containing two crucial pieces of information, the first being the data and the other being the pointer to the next element. The ‘head’ is the first node, and the ‘tail’ is the last node in a linked list.
